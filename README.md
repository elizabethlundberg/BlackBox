## Description

Black Box is a puzzle game invented by Eric Solomon, based on electron microscopes.

Four atoms are placed semi-randomly inside on a grid inside the "black box", inside which the player can't see. The player can shoot rays into the box at the edge, and atoms either be hit with the ray, returning nothing, or can bend the ray, leading it coming out of another exit. Each result gives you more information about the atoms inside.

Aesthetically, I was originally hoping to mimic the complex, exuberant layout and prose of mid-century American board game advertisements. Although the game was invented in the 1970s, the atom theme suggested the 50s style to me. However, I ultimately decided to combine the wowee-zowee text of the classic midcentury ad with the colors of 70s board game materials, like Parcheesi:

The salmon-and-lime color scheme is a little eye-searing, but also evokes that period and style:

## Getting Started

Either clone the repo and open index.html, or just go to [my Surge link](https://blackboxgame.surge.sh). There are no prerequisites. Click on "TUTORIAL" for gameplay instructions.

## Usage

Black Box is a fun way to lose some time. Just use the ray selectors around the outside to gain information, then click on the board to make your guesses and hit submit! Score works like Golf, so try to keep it as low as possible.

## Roadmap

[X] Game is playable

[X] Layout is complete

[ ] Add other modes

[ ] Add ability to change board size or atom number

[ ] Add persistent leaderboard

## Contributing

Feel free to modify the game logic! While the original board game was restricted by a number of factors, a digital version could take a number of forms.
